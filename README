Mobile Web App Project
----------------------

This project is still in development and this document is going to be updated regularly. 

'Go Movies' is a personal portfolio project to show how to make an Web App with jQuery Mobile. This Web Application uses Rotten Tomatoes API which is for users to query movie databases. 

PHP 5.3
CodeIgniter 2.0.3
jQuery Mobile 1.0 rc3

Rotten Tomatoes API

To run this code succesfuly, you should have API key for Rotten Tomatoes server.
1) Get your API key from Rotten Tomatoes developer site. Follow the instructions on the http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/
2) Edit application/config/movie_settings.php with your API key.
   $config['api_key'] = 'rotten_tomatoes_api_key';

One more thing to go. As this project is using CodeIgniter and removed index.php from every URL request, you need also modify .htaccess file in the root directory of this project. 
If Go-Movies is installed on c:/wamp/www/apps/Go-Movies, .htaccess file can be like follwoing code.
Otherwise, you need to change line 3 with directory name what you installed it.
Notice this sample is for Windows Server. 

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /apps/Go-Movies

    #Removes access to the system folder by users.
    #Additionally this will allow you to create a System.php controller,
    #previously this would not have been possible.
    #'system' can be replaced if you have renamed your system folder.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.*
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
    
    #When your application folder isn't in the system folder
    #This snippet prevents user access to the application folder
    #Submitted by: Fabdrol
    #Rename 'application' to your applications folder name.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^application.*
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]

    #Checks to see if the user is attempting to access a valid file,
    #such as an image or css document, if this isn't true it sends the
    #request to index.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
</IfModule>

<IfModule !mod_rewrite.c>
    # If we don't have mod_rewrite installed, all 404's
    # can be sent to index.php, and everything works as normal.
    # Submitted by: ElliotHaughin

    ErrorDocument 404 index.php
</IfModule>
